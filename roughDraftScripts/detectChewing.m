% I think that detecting chewing will be helped by cross correlating the
% files, and also filtering for specific frequencies, just as soon as I
% figure out what those are... Maybe building a carrier wave and finding 4
% hz band power increase would work on a single trace, then cross corr or
% otherwise confirm.
